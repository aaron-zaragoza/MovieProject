# MovieProject

This project was inspired by the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and My Anime List (MAL). It provides full CRUD functionality to create, read, update, and delete the entries added by the user currently logged in.

# Technologies
Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Mongoose, SQLite

# Challenges
The current challenge is related to the error messages generated from validations. When login/registration validations do not pass, the error messages appear on both forms. The simplest solution would be to display these forms on separate pages, but I would ideally like to display them both on the home page.

# Moving Forward
Now the basic CRUD functionality has been implemented, I can begin on improving the user interface and styling. While navigation is relatively straight-forward, I believe this app would benefit from a facelift.
